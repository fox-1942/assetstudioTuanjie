# Unity Build System Code Injection Package

This Unity package provides a code injection point within Unity's build system, serving as the main entry point for the **Context-Aware Shaders** functionality. It is primarily designed for locating the SPIR-V files generated by Unity's build system and invoking the **Annotator** to analyze and decorate these files. The package simplifies the process of integrating the **Context-Aware Shaders** pipeline, specifically targeting **HarmonyOS NEXT** builds.

## Installation

1. Open the **Package Manager** window in Unity.
2. Click on the **+** icon in the top left corner.
3. Select **Add package from disk**.
4. Browse to the location of this package and select the `package.json` file.

For more information on adding packages from disk, see the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html).

## Usage

Once the package is added to your Unity project, the debug outputs will be automatically generated when you build the project. The package ensures that the Context-Aware Shaders pipeline is triggered without requiring additional user steps.

### Integration with Context-Aware Shaders Pipeline

This package automatically hooks into Unity's build system, locates the generated SPIR-V files, and passes them to the **Annotator** for analysis and decoration. This process is triggered automatically during each build, ensuring that the pipeline is executed as needed.

## Debug Output

Upon building, debug output will automatically appear in the Unity Console. This output provides information on the status of the Context-Aware Shaders pipeline, the files being processed, and any relevant diagnostics.
